# Loading data from Windy API
To communicate with our backend API get your own API key [here](https://api4.windy.com/api-key/). Ignore "Allowed domains" fields it this case.

Then use `@windy/pluginDataLoader` module to retrieve the data. More info inside the `plugin.html` or in our [Windy API documentation](../../docs/WINDY_API.md)

Please note, that due to the strict licence conditions, any data retrieved from our backend API, MUST run on windy.com domain only.
